                                information from users so we can more efficiently and creatively

                                with decision-makers and the media, and develop more effective methods
                                for better citizenship</p>

                            <h2>What are the highlights?</h2>

                            <p>Our Privacy Policy is now easier to read and more clearly
                                explains the information we collect from you, how we use it, and how
                                we keep it safe.</p>
                            <p>We do not rent or sell your data -- this hasn’t changed -- but
                                the new policy gives you more details on any data sharing we do and
                                how we secure data transfers across borders.</p>
                            <p>You now have more ways to control your data -- visit
                                your profile page and Cookie Control Settings to learn more. We also
                                describe when we rely on your consent to process your data and when we
                                use a different lawful basis – like when you donate we have a
                                contractual basis to process your info.</p>
                            <p>Finally, we’ve appointed a Data Protection Officer -- you can

                            <p>Targets of Vox Populi petitions: When you sign an Vox Populi

                                Where the target is a government body or official that requires

                                destruction. All donations, including the transmission of payment
                                details and other personal information, are handled over secure,

                            <p>Consent: We will ask for your consent to use your information to
                                send you details about our petitions, fundraisers, and action

                            <p>Contractual relationships: When you donate to us, apply for
                                employment, or otherwise enter into a contract with us, we’ll need to
                                process your personal information. Legal obligations: When strictly
                                necessary, we’ll process your personal information due to a binding

                            <p>Legitimate interests: So long as our use is fair, balanced, and
                                doesn’t unduly impact your rights, we will collect and process your
                                personal information when we have a legitimate interest that serves
                                the Vox Populi mission, our services, or our activities.</p>
                            <p>Processing your Sensitive Personal Data: We do not seek to
                                collect or otherwise process your sensitive personal information (i.e.
                                about race or ethnicity, political opinions, religious or

                                <li>we have obtained your prior explicit consent -- for example,
                                    when you volunteer to complete an opinion survey that includes your
                                    voting intentions.</li>

                            <p>We believe you should have a reasonable expectation of privacy
                                in information you disclose online that is not clearly intended for
                                public dissemination. Where possible, we may attempt to defend this
                                principle even though most jurisdictions currently take the opposition

                                be served, we may cooperate with law enforcement authorities or court
                                orders requesting or directing us to disclose personal information of

                                It will be our general practice, however, to consult with citizens
                                including through randomized polling to determine what user
                                contributions citizenship views as advancing our mission. At all
                                points in this process we will welcome feedback from the community on
                                how we make these decisions as it is the community’s ability to
                                achieve our mission that we are here to serve. But in the end, Vox
                                Populi has a legal obligation to ensure that all of our activities
                                advance our mission and we therefore must reserve final judgment on
                                upholding this requirement.</p>
                            <p>Take any action with respect to any User Contribution that we
                                deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion if we believe
                                that such User Contribution violates the Terms of Use, including the
                                Content Standards, infringes any intellectual property right or other
                                right, threatens the personal safety of users of this website and the
                                public or could create liability for Vox Populi.</p>

                                this lightly, but if we think it has the potential to facilitate a
                                fair and just resolution of the dispute, or will protect Vox Populi
                                from liability for which we are not responsible, we may take this
                                step. See More on Protection of Vox Populi and Others in our Privacy
